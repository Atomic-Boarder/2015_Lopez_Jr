- drive team practice?
- Need to figure out the Network Tables/pots/encoder/general dashboard issues ASAP
- Record a bunch more macros
- Remind Drive team of the semi-auto buttons
- Figure out testing framework
- Iron out turn command & Drive Straight command configurations (speed, rate of rotation)
- Finish commands framework (pref. after competitions so nothing permanently breaks):
    - move files to folders
    - update all commands
    - update oi.py
    - update robot.py
